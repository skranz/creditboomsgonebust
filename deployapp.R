# Deploying an interactive RTutor problem set on shinyapps.io

# 1. Make sure you have generated a package for your problem set and 
#    have it hosted on github

# 2. Install in the subfolder ./app/work all the data sets that are used by
#    your problem set.

# 3. All packages that are used must have be installed in your
#    RStudio from CRAN or GITHUB (a local build of a package does not work)
